# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Rust, playable in both 2-player and 1-player modes (against an AI).

## Getting Started

To run the game, make sure you have Rust installed. If not, you can download and install it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/real0x0a1/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
```

````

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd Tic-Tac-Toe
```

Then, simply run the following command to start the game:

```bash
cargo run
```

## How to Play

1. When you run the game, you'll be presented with a menu:
   - Choose "1" for 2-player mode.
   - Choose "2" for 1-player mode (against an AI).
2. If you choose 2-player mode, you can take turns with another player to make moves on the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

3. If you choose 1-player mode, you'll play against the AI. You'll make your moves, and the AI will respond with its moves.

4. The game continues until one player wins or there's a draw.

5. Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe!
